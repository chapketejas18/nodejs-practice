## Develop a data seeding module that generates mock API responses.

->

## Create a sample POST API that returns a seeded data as a response.

## Develop an authentication middleware using a JWT dummy token.

## Integrate the authentication middleware with the previously created APIs.

## Write a custom middleware function that logs the incoming requests' method, URL, and timestamp to the console.

## Implement an error-handling middleware that captures errors thrown in the route handlers and sends an appropriate error response.

## Write a series of middleware functions and chain them together to demonstrate how multiple middleware can be applied to a single route.

## Build middleware that adds a custom header to every response. Allow the header value to be configurable.

## Develop middleware that limits the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame. Include parameters for setting the limit.
